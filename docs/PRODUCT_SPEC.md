# Basecamp — Product Spec

*Relationships. Momentum. Results.*

A lender-relationship system for an SBA 504 business development officer. This document
describes what Basecamp is, the rules it enforces, and — more usefully — the decisions behind
those rules and the alternatives that were deliberately rejected. It is the reference for anyone
picking this project up.

Companion documents:
- `docs/CONTEXT_HANDOFF.md` — where the work stands right now, conventions, and open questions.
- `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` — the operating manual, rendered in-app at `/guide`.
- `docs/ORIGINAL_BUILD_PLAN.md` — the August 2026 plan this grew from, kept verbatim.

## 1. Who it is for and what it does

**User:** Brandon Toyn, Loan Officer / BDO at InterMountain Business Lending (IMBL), covering the
Wasatch Front (Salt Lake City) and Southern Utah (St. George). One user today; designed for four.

**The job:** he does not originate loans from borrowers. He originates them from *bankers* —
commercial lenders at banks and credit unions who bring him deals that don't fit their own box.
His book is ~142 lenders across 24 institutions. His product is the relationship.

**The problem Basecamp solves.** Those relationships lived in a spreadsheet of names. A
spreadsheet cannot answer the three questions that decide whether a territory produces:

1. **Who haven't I talked to in six weeks?** Relationships go quiet gradually and silently.
2. **Which lenders actually send me deals?** Lunches booked feel like progress; referrals are the
   only outcome that matters.
3. **Does this referral partner know where their loan stands?** Silence after a handoff costs the
   next referral.

Basecamp answers all three, and drafts the outreach that follows from the answers.

**The one-sentence test for any feature:** does it help him know who to contact, contact them, or
keep a partner informed? If not, it does not belong.

## 2. Core domain concepts

| Concept | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Lender** | A person at a bank or credit union. The primary object. Not a company. |
| **Institution** | The bank. Created automatically when a lender is added. Lenders can move between them and keep their history. |
| **Territory** | `Wasatch Front` or `Southern Utah`. Drives trip planning and grouping. |
| **Touch** | Any logged contact. Split into two kinds — see §3. |
| **Coverage** | Whether a lender has been contacted inside the goal window. The engine of the product. |
| **Look** | Any time a lender raises a possible deal — a real referral, a question, a maybe. |
| **Active loan** | A deal in process whose referring lender is owed a weekly update. |
| **Proposal** | An offer of specific meeting times, and the tracking of what came back. |
| **Promise** | Something owed, in either direction. |

---

## 3. The coverage engine

The heart of the product. `src/lib/coverage.ts`, pure and unit-tested.

**The rule:** every active lender should hear from him *personally* every **30 days**, with a
**10-day grace period**. Both are configurable per user.

**States:** `on_track` → `grace` → `overdue` → `seriously_overdue`, plus `never_contacted`.

### Three decisions that define it

**1. A personal touch and a mass email are not the same thing.** Every activity carries
`personal_touch` and `counts_for_coverage`. Coverage is computed twice — a **visible** figure
(any contact) and a **personal** figure (one-to-one only). A lender reached only by campaign shows
as `campaign_only`: technically contacted, actually neglected. Collapsing these would let a
newsletter hide a cold relationship, which is the exact failure the product exists to prevent.

**2. A confirmed future meeting counts as covered immediately.** Not when the meeting happens —
when the invite is accepted. The relationship is handled at that point, and nagging about someone
you are seeing on Thursday is noise.

**3. Two other actions reset the clock**, because they are genuinely contact:
- Logging a **loan update** — informing a referral partner and maintaining the relationship are
  the same act.
- Logging a **look** — someone who just brought you a deal must not appear tomorrow as needing
  attention.

---

## 4. Looks — the outcome measure

`src/lib/looks.ts`. Stored in the `opportunities` table.

**What counts:** *any* conversation where a lender raises a possible deal. A named referral, a
question about whether something would qualify, a vague "I might have one for you." **The borrower
name is optional** — most of these conversations don't have one yet.

**Why so loose:** the original design counted only real referrals with a named borrower. The user
overrode this, and was right: the value is the *follow-up hook*, and waiting for a borrower name
means the conversation never gets logged at all. The count of who's reaching out then falls out for
free.

**The clock is the point.** A look gets a follow-up date (default 3 days, configurable). It goes
gold when due and red after a week — the same colours as the loan clock, so the colours mean one
thing across the app.

**Three outcomes:** `Open` → `Became a loan` or `Went nowhere`. Anything not explicitly closed
counts as open, so an old record asks to be dealt with rather than quietly filing itself away.

**What it produces:** a "who's reaching out" ranking and a lifetime count per lender. This is the
closest thing in the product to an honest answer about which relationships produce and which are
all lunch and no loans.

> **Note for anyone reading the history:** referral tracking was cut during an early scope review
> as "too much," then reinstated. The August plan's addendum called it *"the single highest-value
> thing to add."* The addendum was right and the scope review was wrong.

---

## 5. Loan updates

`src/lib/loan-cadence.ts`, `src/lib/loan-email.ts`.

Every active loan gets a note to the referring lender **every 7 days, whether or not anything
changed.** Silence is what makes a referral partner nervous.

**States:** up to date (teal) → due (gold, days 0–7 past) → overdue (red, day 8+).

### The email

- **Week one** composes a skeleton: greeting, "just wanted to give you my weekly update on the
  Harris loan," a gap for the news, signature. The cursor lands in the gap.
- **Every week after opens with last week's email.** Change what changed. Edits carry forward, so
  the template becomes his rather than staying the app's.
- **Subject is dated** — `Harris loan — update Aug 19` — so each week is its own message rather
  than collapsing into one thread.
- **The borrower can ride along.** Their address is stored on the loan so it's typed once, but the
  tick is per-send and defaults off.
- **Opening the Outlook draft marks the week done** and restarts the clock.

### Two endings

| Action | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| **Sent to closing** | Drafts the handoff email — SBA approved, closing team reaching out, 45–90 days, or on certificate of occupancy if construction is involved. Sending it ends the cadence. |
| **Didn't happen** | Stops the clock, sends nothing. A dead deal is a phone call. |

The closed list records which ending each loan got and counts how many reached closing.

### Rejected designs, and why

- **A five-stage pipeline** (Processing → Underwriting → Board approved → Submitted → SBA
  approved), each with a stock sentence. Designed in full, then dropped on the user's call: *"Every
  week I know where the loan is. I don't need to select something."* A dropdown asks someone to
  type a fact they already know into a second place it can go stale.
- **Predicted SBA response dates.** Explicitly refused: *"Don't add when you think the SBA will get
  back. That's setting up for disaster."*
- **"No change since last week" emails.** Rejected as lame. The stage sentence plus last week's
  text always says something real.
- **Amounts and production numbers.** Deliberately absent everywhere. Those live in the system that
  already owns them, and a second half-kept copy is always the wrong one. The same reasoning removed
  an SBA-approvals card from the dashboard.

## 6. Scheduling

`src/lib/scheduling.ts` (finding slots), `src/lib/reply-reader.ts` (understanding replies).

**The flow is email-first, by design:** pick a lender → the app offers open dates and drafts the
ask → **he proofs and presses send** → the reply is read → a confirmed date becomes a calendar
invite.

### Decisions

**Availability is one window per meeting type**, not a week-by-week grid. Real rules are shaped
like "lunches Tuesday to Thursday, 11 to 1." Coffee is not a meeting type — he doesn't drink it.
Breakfast is.

**The reply reader abstains rather than guesses.** It splits on *clauses*, not sentences, so
"Can't do the 13th, but the 18th works" resolves to the 18th, while an unpicked either/or lands on
`unclear`. Nothing is ever booked from its reading alone — the reading is shown and a human presses
the button. An unclear verdict costs ten seconds; a meeting booked at the wrong time costs a
relationship.

**Wall-clock logic runs in the browser.** Availability windows and reply date-resolution are
wall-clock problems ("lunches 11 to 1", "the 21st"), so both run client-side where local time is
already the user's. Only absolute ISO instants cross to the server. This avoids a timezone
dependency and keeps the logic pure and testable.

**Silence gets chased after 4 days**, configurable.

**Rejected:** a calendar-only flow where the app books directly. It quietly removed his
press-send step, which is the thing he explicitly wants to keep until the tool has earned trust.

### The hands-off goal, and what blocks it

The stated target is: a lender replies, the app reads it, and it only comes to him if it genuinely
needs his call. Two things stand between here and there, and **both** are needed:

| Blocker | Removes |
|---|---|
| Somewhere the app can read replies — a shared mailbox, or delegated `Mail.Read` | The paste step |
| An Anthropic API key | Most of the interruptions |
| (Separately) `Calendars.ReadWrite` | The double-checking of proposed dates against Outlook |

## 7. Screens

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/dashboard` | Coverage ring, relationship momentum, today's actions, this week's list, upcoming agenda |
| `/lenders` | The book. Grouped by territory then bank, collapsed. Search, 11 filter views |
| `/lenders/[id]` | Profile: coverage, timeline, promises, personal details, looks given, bank history |
| `/lenders/new` | Add a lender, with duplicate detection while typing |
| `/institutions`, `/institutions/[id]` | Banks and everyone known at each |
| `/follow-ups` | Open promises (both directions) and tasks |
| `/loans` | Active loans, the weekly clock, the update composer, two endings |
| `/looks` | Looks from lenders, follow-up clock, who's reaching out |
| `/needs-attention` | Everyone slipping, worst first, filterable by state and territory |
| `/settings` | Coverage goal, availability, follow-up intervals, signature, invites, import/export |
| `/import` | Excel import wizard with column mapping |
| `/guide` | `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` rendered in-app |
| `/trash` | 90-day restore for anything soft-deleted |
| `/export` | Full data export |

### The Lenders list — grouping

Territory is the **outer** level and institution the **inner** one. This is not arbitrary: six
banks (Zions, Bank of Utah, Alta, Hillcrest, CC Bank, UCCU) have people in **both** territories,
and those get visited on different trips. A single "Zions" group of 24 would merge two itineraries.

Grouping was validated against the data before being built: **11 banks hold 112 of the 141
people**, so headers carry real weight instead of splintering the list into pairs.

The header is what makes it readable, not the grouping — count, freshest touch in the group, and how
many are slipping. That is enough to skip a healthy bank without opening it. Groups sort
**worst-first** within a territory. **Search always shows the flat list**, because results are
ranked by match quality and grouping would discard that order.

## 8. Privacy and safety

**Row-level security, per user, on every owned table.** Each officer's book is walled off at the
database level — nobody sees anyone else's lenders, notes or pipeline, *including the admin*. This
is enforced by policy, not by a setting someone can switch off, and it is what makes a four-officer
pilot safe.

**Signups are closed.** Accounts are created with single-use invite codes. The `signup_invites`
table has RLS enabled with **no policies**, so it is unreadable through the API; two
security-definer functions are the only way in, and both accept `anon` because someone redeeming a
code has no session yet. The code is validated *before* `signUp` so a bad code cannot leave a
half-made account behind.

**Soft deletes everywhere**, with a 90-day restore window and an append-only audit log.

**AI is optional.** The app is fully functional with no Anthropic key. Every AI path checks a flag
and offers manual entry instead of failing. There is a configurable monthly spend cap.

**No automated sending.** The tool drafts; a person presses send. This is a standing decision, not
a limitation to be engineered away, and should not change without an explicit call.

---

## 9. Non-goals

Stated plainly so they don't get rebuilt:

- **Not a loan pipeline.** No amounts, no stages, no milestones, no production reporting.
- **Not a borrower CRM.** The relationship being tracked is with the *banker*.
- **Not a mass-email platform.** The monthly SBA update is a roadmap item; bulk marketing is not.
- **Not a replacement** for whatever system already tracks loans and approvals.
- **Not multi-tenant SaaS.** Four officers inside one firm.

---

## 10. Roadmap

**Blocked on approvals, not on work:**
- Real Outlook drafts, reply monitoring, calendar conflict checks, actual meeting invitations
  (Microsoft Entra app registration with delegated `Calendars.ReadWrite` and mail permission)
- Drafting in his voice, plain-English reply understanding, pre-meeting briefs (Anthropic API key)
- Four-officer pilot

**Designed, not built:**
- **St. George trip planner** — give it dates and a target of 6–8 meetings; it fills the week from
  the most overdue lenders down there. Tables exist (`trips`, `trip_targets`), no screen. Includes a
  known rule: Mondays are office days *except* when he's in St. George — an exception the current
  availability model cannot express.
- **Monthly SBA update** — one useful email a month to the whole list. Every other touch asks a
  banker for time; this one gives them something. Blocked on real email sending: a newsletter to 141
  people cannot go through a `mailto:` link.
- **Voice samples screen** — paste 3–5 real emails to build a voice profile. Storage ready.
- **Entertainment log** — activity and rough cost per meeting, for compliance records.
- **Job-change alerts** — a banker moving banks is a warm relationship walking into a new lending
  shop; today it is a silent loss.

**Deliberately parked:**
- Automated SMS through a provider (A2P 10DLC registration + TCPA consent). One-to-one texts from
  his own phone are fine and need no infrastructure.
- Video messaging.

## 11. Brand

Renamed from "Lender CRM" to **Basecamp** in August 2026. Mark is a mountain-and-sun; the tagline
is *Relationships. Momentum. Results.*

| Token | Value |
|---|---|
| `--brand-navy` | `#0B1D3A` |
| `--brand-blue` | `#1E5BFF` |
| `--brand-gold` | `#F2B94B` |

The interface derives from these, with two deliberate departures:

- **Interface gold is darker** (`#9A6F14`). `#F2B94B` is a tint, not a text colour; badges need
  contrast the logo doesn't have to provide.
- **Teal, plum and red are not brand colours.** They carry *status* meaning — on track, personal
  intelligence, overdue — and three brand colours cannot express five states.

The mark is vector, traced from the brand sheet raster (`docs/brand/basecamp-brand-sheet.png`) and
living in `src/components/brand.tsx`. If a real vector file ever arrives, replacing the paths there
changes nothing else.
